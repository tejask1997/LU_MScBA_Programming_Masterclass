    """
    Simulation model for a (S,s) inventory system. 
    - Demand comes from a Poisson distribution, and is generated each day
    - If possible, all demand is satisfied that day.
    - Once the inventory has gone below s = reorder_level, an order is placed 
        to restock up to S = capacity, which happens over night.
    - costs include stockout cost, item order cost, fixed order cost and a 
        holding cost

    Parameters
    ----------
    capacity : int
        Maximum capacity.
    reorder_level : int
        Level below which the .
    reps : int
        Number of times to simulate the time horizon.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    A list of the profits over the time horizon for each replication.
